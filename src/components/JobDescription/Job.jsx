            <p>We are a fast-growing Bay Area-based startup backed by leading investors like Menlo Ventures, Accel and Y-Combinator. We create AI and ML-powered software for the finance and lending industries, focused on repayment and debt recovery. We work to improve conversations between call center agents and customers and provide actionable insights. Our products use AI to create next-generation speech analytics that support real-time agent guidance, automated notes after conversations, and call analysis for quality assurance and compliance.</p>
            <p>The team has deep technical talent today and we believe there is an opportunity to build an iconic vertical software business that will fundamentally impact how the multi-trillion-dollar debt industry is managed. Debt has such a massive impact on consumers and prior to Prodigal, the industry was saddled with painful, low value manual workflows, and poor customer experience- our mission is to humanize the debt repayment process through automation and data.</p>
            <p>We are looking for a passionate and seasoned Senior Machine Learning (ML) Engineer to spearhead the design, development, and deployment of cutting-edge Machine Learning and Generative AI solutions towards Prodigalâ€™s vision of building the Intelligence Layer for Consumer Finance.</p>
